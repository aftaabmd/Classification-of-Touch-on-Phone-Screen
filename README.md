# Classification-of-Touch-on-Phone-Screen
A classifier using SVM to differentiate between varying touches on the phone screen was designed; 
â€¢ Training data consists of audio files (generated from sensors inside the phone) and dimensions of the touch.
Features like MFCC were engineered using audio files giving training and test accuracies as 93.5, 91% respectively. 
Language/technologies: Python, Scikit-learn
